/**
 * The JALALI calendar system.
 * <p>
 * This chronology defines the rules of the JALALI calendar system.
 * This calendar system is based on the JALALI-8601 standard, which is the
 * <i>de facto</i> world calendar.
 * <p>
 * The fields are defined as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>era - There are two eras, 'Current Era' (CE) and 'Before Current Era' (BCE).
 * <li>year-of-era - The year-of-era is the same as the proleptic-year for the current CE era.
 * For the BCE era before the JALALI epoch the year increases from 1 upwards as time goes backwards.
 * <li>proleptic-year - The proleptic year is the same as the year-of-era for the
 * current era. For the previous era, years have zero, then negative values.
 * <li>month-of-year - There are 12 months in an JALALI year, numbered from 1 to 12.
 * <li>day-of-month - There are between 28 and 31 days in each of the JALALI month, numbered from 1 to 31.
 * Months 4, 6, 9 and 11 have 30 days, Months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 12 have 31 days.
 * JalaliMonth 2 has 28 days, or 29 in a leap year.
 * <li>day-of-year - There are 365 days in a standard JALALI year and 366 in a leap year.
 * The days are numbered from 1 to 365 or 1 to 366.
 * <li>leap-year - Leap years occur every 4 years, except where the year is divisble by 100 and not divisble by 400.
 * </ul>

     * <p>
     * {@code ChronoField} instances on the JALALI calendar system are resolved
     * as follows.
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@code EPOCH_DAY} - If present, this is converted to a {@code LocalDateJalali}
     * and all other date fields are then cross-checked against the date.
     * <li>{@code PROLEPTIC_MONTH} - If present, then it is split into the
     * {@code YEAR} and {@code MONTH_OF_YEAR}. If the mode is strict or smart
     * then the field is validated.
     * <li>{@code YEAR_OF_ERA} and {@code ERA} - If both are present, then they
     * are combined to form a {@code YEAR}. In lenient mode, the {@code YEAR_OF_ERA}
     * range is not validated, in smart and strict mode it is. The {@code ERA} is
     * validated for range in all three modes. If only the {@code YEAR_OF_ERA} is
     * present, and the mode is smart or lenient, then the current era (CE/AD)
     * is assumed. In strict mode, no era is assumed and the {@code YEAR_OF_ERA} is
     * left untouched. If only the {@code ERA} is present, then it is left untouched.
     * <li>{@code YEAR}, {@code MONTH_OF_YEAR} and {@code DAY_OF_MONTH} -
     * If all three are present, then they are combined to form a {@code LocalDateJalali}.
     * In all three modes, the {@code YEAR} is validated. If the mode is smart or strict,
     * then the month and day are validated, with the day validated from 1 to 31.
     * If the mode is lenient, then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to
     * creating a date on the first of January in the requested year, then adding
     * the difference in months, then the difference in days.
     * If the mode is smart, and the day-of-month is greater than the maximum for
     * the year-month, then the day-of-month is adjusted to the last day-of-month.
     * If the mode is strict, then the three fields must form a valid date.
     * <li>{@code YEAR} and {@code DAY_OF_YEAR} -
     * If both are present, then they are combined to form a {@code LocalDateJalali}.
     * In all three modes, the {@code YEAR} is validated.
     * If the mode is lenient, then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to
     * creating a date on the first of January in the requested year, then adding
     * the difference in days.
     * If the mode is smart or strict, then the two fields must form a valid date.
     * <li>{@code YEAR}, {@code MONTH_OF_YEAR}, {@code ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH} and
     * {@code ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH} -
     * If all four are present, then they are combined to form a {@code LocalDateJalali}.
     * In all three modes, the {@code YEAR} is validated.
     * If the mode is lenient, then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to
     * creating a date on the first of January in the requested year, then adding
     * the difference in months, then the difference in weeks, then in days.
     * If the mode is smart or strict, then the all four fields are validated to
     * their outer ranges. The date is then combined in a manner equivalent to
     * creating a date on the first day of the requested year and month, then adding
     * the amount in weeks and days to reach their values. If the mode is strict,
     * the date is additionally validated to check that the day and week adjustment
     * did not change the month.
     * <li>{@code YEAR}, {@code MONTH_OF_YEAR}, {@code ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH} and

     * form a {@code LocalDateJalali}. The approach is the same as described above for
